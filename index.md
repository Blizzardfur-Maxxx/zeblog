Zeta/Mike's blog for stuff

Hello humans! Welcome to my little site/blog thingy! Hopefully y'all won't copy anything from the github as this is meant to be viewed from the github sites (that's how you're reading this right now... ***right?***)

I'll try to be keeping this updated weekly, but I might forget and I might not post if I have nothing to post about.
