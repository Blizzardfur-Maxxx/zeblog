# 2023-02-13: Minecraft 64bit Coordinates mod archive now available!
Hi! It's been a while, how have you been all you readers who definetly read these. Today I'm finally announcing the official availability of my [64bit coordinate archive!](https://soldev69.github.io/zeblog/downloads/mods/64bit-coordinates/)
These are mods that effectively expand the playable area of minecraft until you start falling through the world, pushing the worldborder as far as it would go, all the way to the 64bit integer at 9.223 quintillion blocks out (however you fall through the world much before then similarly to Bedrock). There are mods for most versions ranging from early Infdev to release 1.19.2! If you find any bugs please report any bugs to the [Cursed Creations discord server](https://discord.gg/gBXj5j55uf) where these mods are made.
